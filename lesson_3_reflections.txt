*** When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local? ***

Anytime you're working on a team, want backups offsite, or want to centrally
locate files in lieu of having them locally

*** Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? ***

to be able to cobtrol when and how Git updates your working directory.

*** L03Q03 Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When
would you use one instead of another?

Forks - copy of repo on GitHub: for starting with someone elses publicly
available work while attributing their contribution on GitHub

Clones - local copies of repos: for experimenting locally with different
features and bug fixes

Branches - copying a commit to a new hierarchy: for trying new things similar to
clones but more granular and within a repo

*** What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?***

retain information on the server for merging results back from local copies.
