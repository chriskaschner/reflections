*** When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local? ***

Anytime you're working on a team, want backups offsite, or want to centrally
locate files in lieu of having them locally

*** Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? ***

to be able to cobtrol when and how Git updates your working directory.
