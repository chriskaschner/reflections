*** What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it? ***
Git creates a .git file that tracks any changes to files within the repository.
It also sets the stage for the ability to begin committing.

*** How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers? ***

A staging area lets me define what files get added to a repository.  By giving
me more control, I can do things like- exclude system files (e.g. .DS_store), 
or limit the number of files in my initial commit (e.g. separating lesson 1 & 2)

*** How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per 
logical change? ***

The staging area makes it much easier to separate out changes.  Then I can stage
one file, commit, comment and repeat as necessary for all files allowing
manageable chunks per commit.
