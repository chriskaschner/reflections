*** What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it? ***
Git creates a .git file that tracks any changes to files within the repository.
It also sets the stage for the ability to begin committing.

*** How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers? ***

A ataging area lets me define what files get added to a repository.  By giving
me more control, I can do things like- exclude system files (e.g. .DS_store), 
or limit the number of files in my initial commit (e.g. separating lesson 1 & 2)
